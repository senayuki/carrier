# Carrier
Carrier is a simple HTTP&TCP(right now) reverse proxy.

The main goal of this project is to provide fast configurable port forwarding and apply SSL certificates for HTTPS requests.
In the future, the project may be expanded to include OpenWrt LuCI configuration, but we do not intend to implement more complex functionality based on path matching or similar techniques.
